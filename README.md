# Skiddle React Test - Alex Zabiela

This application uses the Skiddle API to allow a user to search for an event, check out event details and also read artist information.

## Installation

Install by navigating to command line / terminal and entering:

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

Run by navigating to command line / terminal and entering:

```bash
npm start
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and imply type in the name of an event/artist/location to find relevant events.

Or view on Netlify: https://skiddle-test.netlify.app/
 
## Features
- Fully responsive
- Reusable components
- Dynamic button styling depending if event is cancelled

## Improvements

With more time I would like to:
- Implement unit testing
- Add pre-commit hooks to lint code
- Expand further with content and styling of details pages
